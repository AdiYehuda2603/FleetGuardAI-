### 2. Workshop Optimization Initiative
**Impact:** 💰 **₪36,780/year savings**

#### Current State
| Workshop | Avg Cost | Total Invoices | Efficiency Rank |
|----------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| יוסי צמיגים ופרונט | ₪1,217 | 197 | ❌ Most Expensive |
| מוסך צי צפון | ₪1,128 | 162 | ⚠️ Above Average |
| עובד חלפים מקוריים | ₪1,050 | 175 | ⚠️ Above Average |
| **מוסך העיר** | **₪843** | 161 | ✅ **Most Cost-Effective** |
| מוסך המרכז | ₪865 | 130 | ✅ Cost-Effective |

**Cost Difference:** יוסי צמיגים is **44% more expensive** than מוסך העיר

**Recommendation:**
- Redirect 50% of services from יוסי צמיגים ופרונט → מוסך העיר
- Negotiate volume discount with מוסך העיר (target: 10%)
- Audit מוסך העיר quality before major shift

**Savings Calculation:**
```
Current avg: ₪1,217/service × 100 services = ₪121,700
Target avg:  ₪843/service × 100 services = ₪84,300
Annual Savings: ₪37,400
```

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Workshop Quality Trade-off**
   - **Risk:** Lower-cost workshops may compromise quality
   - **Mitigation:** Monthly quality audits, track re-work rates
   - **Threshold:** If re-work rate >5%, revert to previous workshop

2. **Driver Resistance to Monday Scheduling**
   - **Risk:** Operational constraints may prevent Monday preference
   - **Mitigation:** Incentivize Monday bookings, flexible for emergencies
   - **Fallback:** Thursday also shows good value (₪994 avg)

3. **Model Prediction Drift**
   - **Risk:** ML accuracy degrades as fleet composition changes
   - **Mitigation:** Quarterly model retraining with new data
   - **Threshold:** MAPE >7% triggers immediate retraining

4. **Tire Supplier Dependency**
   - **Risk:** Bulk contract locks into single supplier
   - **Mitigation:** 6-month contract renewal, maintain 2 backup suppliers
   - **Monitoring:** Track delivery times and quality metrics

5. **Vehicle Retirement Timing**
   - **Risk:** Premature retirement loses residual value
   - **Mitigation:** ROI analysis for each vehicle, 3-month monitoring period
   - **Decision Rule:** Retire only if annual cost >₪3,000 AND age >5 years
